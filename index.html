    Plant a Bee Garden: <br> <br>
    One of the largest threats to bees is a lack of safe habitat where they can build homes and find a variety of nutritious food sources. 
    By planting a bee garden, you can create a habitat corridor with plants that are rich in pollen and nectar. You don’t need a ton of space to 
    grow bee-friendly plants — gardens can be established across yards and in window boxes, flower pots, and planters. 
    You can also get involved with local organizations and governments to find opportunities to enrich public and shared spaces.

  <div class="alert alert-secondary">
    Go Chemical-Free for Bees: <br> <br>
    Synthetic pesticides, fertilizers, herbicides, and neonicotinoids are harmful to bees, wreaking havoc on their sensitive systems. 
    Avoid treating your garden and green spaces with synthetics. Instead, use organic products and
    natural solutions such compost to aid soil health and adding beneficial insects that keep pests away like ladybugs and praying mantises.

    Become a Citizen Scientist: <br> <br>
    Join a global movement to collect data on our favorite pollinators! Gather photos and other information about native bees and upload 
    them to the iNaturalist app. Make it a group activity for friends by hosting a BeeBlitz event! Together, we can learn about the bees 
    in various sites and cities and identify opportunities for nurturing them

  <div class="alert alert-secondary">
    Provide Trees for Bees: <br><br>
    Did you know that bees get most of their nectar from trees? When a tree blooms, it provides hundreds — if not thousands — of blossoms to feed from.
    Trees are not only a great food source for bees, but also an essential habitat. Tree leaves and resin provide nesting material for bees, 
    while natural wood cavities make excellent shelters. With deforestation and development on the rise, you can help bolster bee habitats by 
    caring for trees and joining tree-planting parties in your area.

  <div class="alert alert-primary">
    Build Homes for Native Bees: <br><br>
    Did you know that, with the exception of honeybees, most bees are solitary creatures? 70% of solitary bees live underground, while 30% live in holes inside of 
    trees or hollow stems. Species like bumble bees build their nests in undisturbed land, and you can provide safe haven for them by leaving an 
    untouched plot of land for them in your garden! “Bee condos” — which have small tube “apartments” — allow species like mason bees to take up residence. 
    They’re easy to make or purchase. Our Sponsor-a-Hive program places solitary bee homes in gardens, schools, and communities around the U.S. and Canada.
